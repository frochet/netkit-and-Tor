You need the following packet

bison
flex
automake => automake-1.13 is bugged (jan 2014). Dowload version 1.11
debootstrap
libvdeplug-dev
libpcap-dev

-------------------------------
installation :

go in netkit-core/

autoreconf --install
./configure
make
sudo make install


then in netkit-uml-kernel

autorecof --install
./configure
make
sudo make install

then in netkit-uml-filesyste

autoreconf --install
./configure
make
sudo make install


If you have errors during compilation, you probably not have a .h. Try to see during the compilation which .h is missing and install the dev packet to get it.

Now you should have the following directory

/usr/local/share/netkitcore
/usr/local/share/netkituml
/usr/local/share/netkitumlk

in /usr/local/share/netkitcore/netkit.conf change the path to the filesystem and the path to the kernel. 

VM_MODEL_FS="/usr/local/share/netkitcore/fs/netkit-fs"        # Model filesystem for all virtual machines
VM_KERNEL="/usr/local/share/netkitcore/kernel/netkit-kernel"  # Virtual machine kernel

To :

VM_MODEL_FS="/usr/local/share/netkituml/default-fs"        # Model filesystem for all virtual machines
VM_KERNEL="/usr/local/share/netkitumlk/mptcp-ker"  # Virtual machine kernel
